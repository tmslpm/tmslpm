Hey! Here, you'll discover the result of my frontend development work with Angular 17,
using TypeScript and Sass. My main goal is to enhance my skills with the Angular
framework by creating a functional version of the renowned Pokedex.

## Why ?

During my Java Fullstack qualification training, we had an exercise
on Angular where we needed to fetch JSON data from a remote API and
display it in our Angular frontend. I took this opportunity to create
a real Pokedex, which allowed me to discover and appreciate Angular,
even though I was initially a fan of VueJS.

Here are the features I implemented:

- i18n support (internationalization)
- Caching strategy for API responses
- Service using the native Fetch API
- Service using Angular's HttpClient API
- Dark/light CSS theme
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) for the Pokedex
- Cool animations for the Pokedex

> PS: The Pokedex is not yet responsive and there are still optimizations to be made.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and this experience really made me appreciate Angular. Check out the project in detail and let me know your thoughts!
